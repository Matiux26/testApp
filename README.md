For convenience i run this example by first starting Client app  by symfony server:start and then api by symfony server:start.
For Api I used maker bundle to generate entity and api platform to generate rest api for entity. This allowed me to reduce boiler plate code. I could of course write it myself and return ready to use datasets but from my experience you can't count on api to do all the work.
